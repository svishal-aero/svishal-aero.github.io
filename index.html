          Hello there! I am Vishal, an aerospace engineer working at the intersection of data-driven methodologies, computational science, and fluid mechanics.
          While the tools I develop are relevant for several engineering disciplines, my research work primarily revolves around data-driven modeling of transition and turbulence in fluid flows.
          I graduated with a B.Tech. in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in 2016, and a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2022 (Go Blue!).
          During my Ph.D., I worked at the
          <a href="https://caslab.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Aerosciences Laboratory</a>
          under the supervision of my advisor,
          <a href="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/duraisamy-karthik/">Prof. Karthik Duraisamy</a>,
          on creating methodologies to infer generalizable model augmentations for numerical models - predominantly closure models for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations - from limited data.
          <br>
          <br>
          I currently work as a Senior Scientist at
          <a href="https://www.flexcompute.com">Flexcompute</a>
          where I collaborate with some of the best people in the industry in meshing, numerics, solver development and PhysicsAI, to constantly improve the capabilities of our already best-in-class GPU-native CFD solver Flow360.
          I have previously worked as a Senior Aerospace Engineer at Analytical Mechanics Associates where I collaborated with highly esteemed researchers at NASA Langley Research Center on data-driven transition and turbulence modeling.

        <br>
        Through all my experiences, I have gathered significant expertise in scientific machine learning, numerical methods, high-performance computing (MPI/OpenMP/CUDA), optimization, inverse problems, uncertainty quantification, and scientific visualization.
        Over my career, I have used these skills to implement end-to-end scientific computing and machine learning workflows/pipelines including an unstructured, fully differentiable, adjoint-driven RANS solver to perform field inversion and machine learning studies
        that scaled to thousands of CPU cores.
        Outside work, I enjoy recreational programming, solving physics/mathematics problems, reading fiction/non-fiction, chess, long walks, and spending time with my lovely wife.
